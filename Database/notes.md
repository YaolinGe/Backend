# Database technology 
`CRUD` operations: Create, Read, Update, Delete

## Databases and data 
- `object oriented databases` store data as objects, which can be manipulated through object-oriented programming languages.
- `relational databases` store data in tables, which can be manipulated using SQL.
- `graph databases` store data in nodes and edges, which can be manipulated using graph query languages.
- `document databases` store data in documents, which can be manipulated using document query languages.
- `cloud hosting` is a way to store data on the internet, rather than on a local server.
- `NoSQL databases`: use a non-relational data model, which can be more flexible than a relational data model.
    - `key-value stores` store data as key-value pairs.
    - `column-family stores` store data in columns, rather than rows.
